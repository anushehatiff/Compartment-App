# Comp-ART-ment
Simple app that uses the Processing P5 drawing libraries (using java-based code) to generate computational art with user input

## Overview
This was my first side project I made to explore basic app development! I really enjoyed this project as I was able to combine my creativity along with my passion for math and coding! 
Please note this was done a while ago when I was new to coding and so the formatting can be cleaned up! 
 
* this project was done in collaboration with Raimah Farouqi
